While most articles on geeksforgeeks focus on technique aspect of programming, this article introduce software engineering itself as a technique in a properous industry in which involces more on project management, quality control, costumer satisfication and mass productivity. It is noteworthy that the descipline has organized a systematic approach with pros and cons regarding itself as a business model for profit. It shows that in one's career, software development is more than coding. 
Considering software engineering technique in modern era has taken a form of incremental life cycle involving repeated technique of design, developing, and testing. Software engineering should be treated as an independent discipline besides computer science technology because it is more related to communication, collaboration, and order. The softcore aspect of this discipline matters more once the students enter the work force and participate in their career.

### Brendan Tang's comment

This article articulates the key fundamentals and values of software engineering. There is a strong emphasis of the key principles including Modularity, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Reusability, Maintenance, Testing, Design Patterns, Agile methodologies, and Continuous Integration & Deployment. In addition, software engineers must have a good understanding of their identity. They are either working on a product or vehicles for a specific product. Software engineering is used for its high distribution and low costs for businesses.
